	abstract = {The recent phenomena of tremendous growth in wireless communication application urge increasing need of radio spectrum, albeit it being a precious but natural resource. The recent technology under development to overview the situation is the concept of Cognitive Radio ({CR}). Recently the Artificial Intelligence ({AI}) tools are being considered for the topic. {AI} is the core of the cognitive engine that examines the external and internal environment parameters that leads to some postulations for {QoS} improvement. In this article, we propose a new Artificial Neural Network ({ANN}) model for detection of a spectrum hole. The model is trained with some pertinent features over a channel like {SNR}, channel capacity, bandwidth efficiency etc. The channel capacity status could be identified in a quantized index form . Some simulation results are presented.},
