	abstract = {Compounding the confusion is the use of the broad term cognitive radio as a synonym for dynamic spectrum access. As an initial attempt at unifying the terminology, the taxonomy of dynamic spectrum access is provided. In this article, an overview of challenges and recent developments in both technological and regulatory aspects of opportunistic spectrum access ({OSA}). The three basic components of {OSA} are discussed. Spectrum opportunity identification is crucial to {OSA} in order to achieve nonintrusive communication. The basic functions of the opportunity identification module are identified},
