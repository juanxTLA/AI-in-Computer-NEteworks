	abstract = {Dynamic spectrum access ({DSA}) has the great potential to alleviate spectrum shortage and promote network capacity. However, two fundamental technical issues have to be addressed, namely, interference coordination between {DSA} users and interference suppression for primary users ({PUs}). These two issues are very challenging since generally there is no powerful infrastructures in {DSA} networks to support centralized control. As a result, {DSA} users have to perform spectrum management individually, including spectrum access and power allocation, without accurate channel state information and centralized control. In this article, a novel spectrum management framework is proposed, in which Q-learning, a type of reinforcement learning, is utilized to enable {DSA} users to carry out effective spectrum management individually and intelligently. For more efficient process, neural networks ({NNs}) are employed to implement Q-learning processes, so-called deep Q-network ({DQN}). Furthermore, we also investigate the optimal way to construct {DQN} considering both the performance of wireless communications and the difficulty of {NN} training. Finally, extensive simulation studies are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed spectrum management framework.},
